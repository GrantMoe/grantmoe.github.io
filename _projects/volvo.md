## Overview

My 2006 Volvo S40 is a quirky little car that's starting to show its age. It has the occasional wiring issue. It has taken some dings. It's somewhat Scandinavian.

Basically, I can relate.

I also get to fix it!

## Things I've Done

* replace right motor mount
* replace timing belt
* replace mass airflow sensor
* install missing (?!) air intake (long story)
* replace trunk wiring harness and handle
* replace both front control arms
* replace inner front driver-side CV boot
* new spark plugs, several oil changes
* refresh engine compartment wire harness wrapping
* replace/upgrade sun roof drain tubes
* replace door wiring harness connector
* replace coolant hoses
* replace burnt-out headlight bulbs

## Things I've Yet to Do

* replace a side-view mirror destroyed by a car wash (long story)
* replace door flash destroyed by car wash (see above)
* redo the headlining
* find out why the radio isn't working
* reupholster driver door arm rest
* pay to get some dings fixed
