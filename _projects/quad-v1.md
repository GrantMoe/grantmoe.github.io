### Overview
- Evolution of a project intended to spray insulation foam under rafters (don't ask)
- First-ever experience with multirotors
- Pretty cool

### Status
- Flies
- Propellers tend towards independent flight
- Quad itself tends towards pitching back

### TODO
- Recalibrate IMU
- Beef up landing gear to cushion bounces
