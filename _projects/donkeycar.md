## Overview
[Donkey Car](https://www.donkeycar.com/) is an open-source hardware platform and software framework for machine-learning based autonomous driving.

This is my take on the basic platform, built with the [Epliog Desktop laser cutter](http://crashspace.pbworks.com/w/page/32200358/Laser) and [Prusa MK3S+ printer](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-i3-mk3s/) at [CRASH Space](https://blog.crashspace.org/).

## Components
- Chassis: [Exceed RC Magnet Off Road Truck](https://www.nitrorcx.com/51c853-fireblue-24-ghz.html)
- Brains: [Jetson Nano (4GB)](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
- Steering/Throttle: [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html)
- Vision: [IMX219-200 camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T73PQQW)

## Status
Temporarily placed aside in favor of the ~faster~ 1/10 scale robocar.

This was probably a mistake. Slower and smaller is better for everything that isn't a race track. I will most likely revisit 1/16 scale shortly.
