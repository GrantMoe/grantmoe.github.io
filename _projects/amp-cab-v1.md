## Amplifier Cabinet v1

### Overview
- I once owned a giant, heavy combo amp. I designed a lightweight speaker cabinet to convert it into a head/cab pair
- I have since sold the combo amp, and barely play guitar anymore thanks to tendinitis

### Status
- Indefinite hold

### TODO
- Install handle
- Install speaker
- Wire speaker and connector
