## Overview
I needed a controller for my DIY Quad, and I didn't have a lot of money, so I found cheap guts on EBay, purchased new ~hall effect~ gimbals, then went to town with CAD.

I then gave up on CAD and used a cardboard box.

## Components
- Base innards: [FlySkyRC FS-i6](https://www.flysky-cn.com/fsi6) (used)
- Right Stick: [FrSky M9 Hall Effect Gimbal](https://www.frsky-rc.com/product/m9/)
- Left Stick: [FrSky M9-R Hall Effect Gimbal](https://www.frsky-rc.com/product/m9-r/)
- Battery: [RDQ Series 7.6V 2S 3500mAh HV LiPo Battery](https://www.racedayquads.com/collections/rdq-series-batteries/products/rdq-series-7-6v-2s-3500mah-qx7-compatible-lipo-battery-xt30)
- Additional hardware: Whatever I could find lying around the house/makerspace

## Status
### Cardboard
Complete! 100% functional. Hacks to be described in a blog post.

### Not-Cardboard
In the works. The quadcopter itself has been abandoned for cars, so it could be a while before I get around to making a better case for this (should I decide I need one).
