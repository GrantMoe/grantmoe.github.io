Hello and welcome to my site! Iâ€™m Grant.

Soon there will be blog posts!

In the meantime, see below for some of my projects.

<!-- In my spare time I build (nearly) autonomous race cars, and I am active in the Los Angeles maker community. I am a board member at [CRASH Space](https://blog.crashspace.org/), where I host monthly neuroscience and robotics meetups, and I organize events for the [DIY Robocars Los Angeles Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/DIY-Robocars-Los-Angeles/) (paused for pandemics). -->
