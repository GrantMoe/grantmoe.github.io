  summary: >
    Grant wants to be a mad scientist and/or autonomous vehicle wrangler. 
    He is excited to leverage artificial intelligence to solve real-world
    problems. He has most recently attended a data science immersive boot 
    camp to  build foundational machine learning and neural network modeling 
    skills.

    His non-work interests range wildly, but most involve tinkering and working
    with his hands, whether it's using CAD to design tools for use around the
    house or building custom guitar amplifiers.
