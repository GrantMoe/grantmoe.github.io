  summary: >
    Grant wants to be a mad scientist and/or autonomous vehicle wrangler. 
    He is excited to leverage artificial intelligence to solve real-world
    problems. He has most recently attended a data science immersive boot 
    camp to  build foundational machine learning and neural network modeling 
    skills.

    His non-work interests range wildly but mostly involve tinkering and working
    with his hands, whether it's using CAD to design tools for use around the
    house or building custom guitar speaker cabinets.

      "In the Cognitive Anteater Robotics Laboratory (CARL) at the University of California, Irvine, we are designing robotic systems whose behaviors are guided by large-scale simulations of the mammalian brain. Because these simulated nervous systems are embodied on a robot, they provide a powerful tool for studying brain function."
