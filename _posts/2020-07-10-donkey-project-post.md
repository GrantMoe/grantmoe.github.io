There is now a [project page for my Donkey Car]({% link _projects/00-donkey-v1.md %})! 

[Donkey Car](https://www.donkeycar.com/) is an open source robotic platform that combines RC cars, Raspberry Pi, and Python.

They are easy to assemble and easy to customize. The codebase is well maintained, and the Donkey Car community is active and friendly.

They are a brilliant introduction to machine learning.
