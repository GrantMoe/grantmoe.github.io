There is now a [project page for my Donkey Car]({% link /_projects/00-donkey-v1.md %})! 

Donkey Cars are open source robotic platforms.

The default configuration uses an inexpensive RC car, a Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano, and a pi-compatible camera. They are easy to build and easy to customize, and their modular software is easy to modify.

They are a brilliant introduction to machine learning.

See [donkeycar.com](https://www.donkeycar.com/) for more about these great little robots.
