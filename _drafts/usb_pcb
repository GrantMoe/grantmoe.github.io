I fell in love with these ruggedized USB connectors; I feel like I can avoid having to open up a project box repeatedly using them.

I started with the intention of CNC milling my own PCBs. As such, I debated single vs double sided, and looked up how best to DIY things like plated through-holes and vias.

I then discovered/realized that OSHPark would be cheaper and, due to the small pins/spacing of the connector, easier.

My KICAD strategy changed.

The first version was too long.

This version is just right.

I am holding off on soldering them for now; by the time they are needed, requirements might have changed.

I enjoy having something to show. I've made it. It's simple, but it's mine.
