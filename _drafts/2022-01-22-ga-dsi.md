I wanted to learn the fundamentals of data science, I wanted to do it quickly, and I wanted professional guidance through the job-search process.

Thus, boot camp!

I chose General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course because it ticked all the boxes for what I wanted to learn, it ended in 12 weeks instead of the 24/36/more for other boot camps, and it offered an income-sharing agreement (which I believe aligns their interests with mine).

I took the plunge, signed up, and had a great time! The instructors and support staff are thorough, responsive, approachable, etc., basically everything one would want.
